    "\n",
    "In the below code, I have chosen Approach no.1 from the Assignment Question. I am choosing to calculate the average distance from residents to their nearest FQHC as the measure of fitness of the location. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why? \n",
    "It is simple and easy to understand, and it is also computationally efficient, running faster than alternative approaches. Also, this approach works better where there is uniform population density.\n",
    "\n",
    "What assumptions am I making?\n",
    "1. Assuming equal importance of all residences, that is, there is even population density across all residences. This is unlikely to be true in the real world but as I don't know how the data is collected I am making this assumption.\n",
    "2. Assuming average captures best accessibility, even though some residents may be very far.\n",
    "3. Assuming distance is best indicator of accesibility: Actually, distance might not be the best determinant to accessibilty, since there are other factors like closeness to public transport, geographical barriers, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe your fitness function?\n",
    "    My fitness function takes two arguments, \n",
    "    1. the FQHC solution subset containing 8 FQHCs (from the initialized population) and \n",
    "    2. the population geoDataFrame which contains information about all the residences\n",
    "\n",
    "    First, both dataframes have re-projected Coordinate Reference System (CRS) to Missouri East (EPSG=26996).\n",
    "    Then, using sjoin_nearest, get information about nearest FQHCs in the subset, to all residences in pop_gdf. We store the geometry object as two different columns\n",
    "    Then, get distance between those two points and get mean value across all residences. \n",
    "    Then, apply a distance penalty when average distance is greater than 11,000mi - because I calculated the actual absolute minimum solution in this dataset and it is 11,000mi avg distance.\n",
    "    Then, divide by 10000 to get a smaller, easy to interpret fitness value.\n",
    "    Finally, return this fitness value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I am using average distance as the metric, I am aiming to *minimize* this value.\n",
